# CATBeginnerTask
repo for uploading the beginner task at CATRealoaded
first i have took an overview on the whole task's questions
i have known this concepts before from my studies but it just needed some revision to me 
so the questions i already have known the answers i answered it immediately 
on the other hand the questions needed to be revisioned i searched on the topics and learned and answered it
after answering all questions i collected the answers in one pdf and upload it into this repository.
